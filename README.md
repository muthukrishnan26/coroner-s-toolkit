The Coroner's Toolkit (aka TCT) was written by myself and my erstwhile
collegue, Wietse Venema, and was originally released (I think? :))
in 1999. This is fossil ware, basically :)

I might claim that it was the first foray into the more serious
field of computer forensics, which until that time had been a bit
mired in dd'ing disks and that sort of thing.

I guess my main things in here were Lazarus (invented data carving
and gave the first ray of hope to recovering lost data on UNIX/Linux
style systems; basically wrote it over a weekend with a bit of
insight) & MACtimes. Wietse did all the hard C stuff, and ported
file(1) for my pathetically slow Laz.

Brian Carrier took TCT and created Sleuthkit from it; I'd advise you
to seek out his stuff or other tools for modern forensic challenges....
